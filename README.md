# verifast-exercise
[VeriFast](https://github.com/verifast/verifast) is a research prototype of a tool for modular formal verification of correctness properties of single-threaded and multithreaded C and Java programs.

VeriFast will verify the following contents.
* Calculation result satisfies the specification.
* Memory safety.
* No overflow/underflow.
* Illegal lock/unlock in concurrent programming.
* Halting problem.

Here, I will solve the [tutorial](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/tutorial.pdf) exercises.

If you hate bugs more, you may want to use [CompCert C compiler](http://compcert.inria.fr) together.
